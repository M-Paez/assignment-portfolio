# assignment-portfolio
This is where all of my Lewis University Software Engineering with Eric Pogue assignments will be.

This assignment follows all of Eric Pogue's coding standards for this class.
This assignment is of my own work with ChatGPT being used to debug a few issues. As well as YouTube videos to help create the navigation bar.
